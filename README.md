### Gameplay
Players start with three hearts and need to kill all invaders in order to win. The player loses if they lose all of their hearts or the invaders reach their spaceship.

We have implemented a number of obstacles. They will block your bullets, but will break if they are shot five times.

A UFO, which is faster than the invaders and flies above them, have implemented too. Defeating it gives a lot of points.

On the right side of the screen, you can see the number of remaining hearts, the time you spend and your current score.
